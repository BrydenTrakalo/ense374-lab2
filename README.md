The add new task and remove completed tasks works.

Ive spent a lot of time trying to find a way to implement the interactivity easily. But if i used a javascript function to listen for the claim button to be clicked, id have no way to know which of the tasks it is that needs to be changed. I coudve used form to submit the text, owner and completeion information on a task when claim or abandon but i couldnt find a way to connect my localhost to uregina to use the MySql databse, or to access the files i uploaded from http://www2.cs.uregina.ca/~bwt562/

I added in a nav bar to easily access the login and home pages
